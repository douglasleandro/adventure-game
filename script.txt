You find yourself standing in an open field, filled with grass and yellow wildflowers.
Rumor has it that a pirate/gorgon/troll/wicked fairie is somewhere around here, and has been terrifying the near by village.
In front of you is a house.
To your right is a dark cave.
In your hand you hold your trusty (but not very effective) dagger.

Enter 1 to knock on the door of the house.
Enter 2 to peer into the cave.

You are about to knock when the door opens and out steps a pirate/gorgon/troll/wicked fairie.
Eep! This is the pirate/gorgon/troll/wicked fairieÂ´s house!
The pirate/gorgon/troll/wicked fairie attacks you!
You feel a bit under-prepared for this, what with only having a tiny dagger.
